ANGULARJS:

- A client side JS Framework
- Developed and being maintained by Google.
- Goals
    - Separate DOM manipulation from application logic.
    - Separate of concerns (using MVC like pattern)
    - Make SPA development easier.
    - Extensibility & Customization. 



Angular Module:
syntax: angular.module("sample", []);
- second  parameter as [] array defines that we are creating new module, if second parameter is not there it means we are
retrieving existing module which is already created.
-It contains all the application logic 
-One module can contain sevral component . And each component can communicate with server and work with server.

Angular Application :
<body ng-app="sample">
-this attribute needs to be added under any of the html tag. So once the angular is loaded it searchesfor ng-app
attribute in html page if it find that the it tries to execute angular code.
-ng-app="sample" means we are directly attaching this angular application with sample module.

{{ 1 + 2}} = it is called angular expressions. but it is nothing but javascript statements.



High Level Overview - Angular process:
1. Angularjs is included and expecuted in script tag.
    -Then it starts the angularjs engine , then it will go through the entire mark up and try to find all relative components
     try to parse them load them and execute them.
2. Angular module is created.
3. Finds the template.
    -You might be having several block of html block in you application and those html block may have angular related 
     component are called template.
     'ng-*' attributes are called directives.
4. Process Template
    a. Compiles template. (for errors).
    -Angularjs engine has something called as html compiler. That is the compiler get in picture when it finds the 
    template in html page.
    b. Load Template(instance) in memory.(memory means browser memory).
    c. Transforms template with data
        -data binding
        -Evaluation of expressions.
    Once all the processes are completed , their result with generate the DOM . and that gets passed to the browser.
5. Renders to DOM tree(View).
