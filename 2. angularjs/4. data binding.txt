Data Binding:

1. Establishing the connection between view and controller.
2. Syncronizing data between view and controller and vice-versa.
This is amde avaible though the angular data binding.

One Way Data Binding:

View                                                <---      <---     <--- Controller
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Markup                                                                        Scope

-Data Flows from SCope to View-
-Scope data 
    -Gets propogated to view
    -Even after data propogated in view If scope is modified again data will be propogated in view.
-View Data
    -From view side no propogation happens back to the scope.
-To achieve One Way Data Binding we use ng-bind or expression 


Two Way Data Binding:

View                                                <---      <---     <--- Controller
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Markup --->       --->         --->                                            Scope


-Data Flows from SCope to View and vice-versa.
-Scope Data
    -Gets propogated to view
    -Even after data propogated in view If scope is modified again data will be propogated in view.
-View Data
    - view Data gets propogated to Scope.
    -Even after data propogated in scope If view is modified again data will be propogated in scope.

-Two Data Binding achieved through ng-model.


One Time Data Binding:

View                                 <----                                Controller
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Markup                                                                      Scope


-Data Flows from SCope to View.
-Scope Data
    -Gets propogated to view(Only once for the first time)
    -Even after data propogated in view If scope is modified No data propogation will happen.
-View Data
    - view Data not propogated to Scope.
    -Even after data propogated in scope If view is modified again data will be propogated in scope.

-One Time Data Binding achieved through :: as a part of evaluation expression.
