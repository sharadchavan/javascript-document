Angular Services:

1. Service is special unit of code which can be used accross different controller.
2. Service can be utilities or business logic units.
-Business logic should be in service , it should not be the part of controller.
-Controllers are ment to receive the data and provide the data to views.
3. Service is a singleton.(means you will have only single instance of service accross your entire application)
- Same instance is maintained throughout the life time of application.
-Unlike services, controllers are created as they are needed and destroyed if they are not in use.
-Controllers are dynamic in nature, how ever services are static in nature. Because once the instance of the service
is created, same instance will living as part of memory.And same instnace will used throughout all the controller and 
Angularjs application.
-Controllers are dynamic in nature because once the controller is instantiated and then other view is loaded then that previous views
controller will be destroyed. and new views controller will be instantiated.
4. Services are loaded and instantiated lazily.
5. We can have multiple services and used by multiple controllers.
6. Services can work with other services.


Services Types:
1. Built-In services - Part of Angular Framework 
Ex. $http, $log, $location etc.
2. Custom services.
