CONTROLLERS:
1. Controllers are javascript objects which contain application logic.
 - Usually defined as part of angular module.
 -You can create multiple controller in module.

syntax :
 const sample = angular.module("sample", []);
 sample.controller("employee", function () {
    this.name = "John";
 });

 2. Controller allow us to send/receive data between DOM (view) and application logic.

 3. Usually attached to DOM element using 'ng-controller'(directive) attribute.
 <body ng-app="sample">
    <div ng-controller="employee as emp">
        Hello {{ emp.name}}!
    </div>
 </body>

 -So ng-controller from view is directly tightly coupled with controller from angular module.
 -Consider every controller as class . so class needs to be instantiated. so here in view
 employee as emp has been instantiated.

 4. Inother words, controller can directly provide the data to the view(One-way-data-binding).
 -Also view can send data back to the controller is called two way data binding.

 5. In markup when angular finds ng-controller attribute it add ng-binding and ng-scope class to that div.



 WRAPPING UP CONTROLLERS:

 1. Controllers are actually sending the information to the view in the form of Model. So view does not understand
 the controller ,it understands the Model.
 -Views strongly binds to the model and coontroller knows what kind of model it needs to generate.
 2. In order to get model which means all the data So data usually resides in database. But angularjs resides at client side
 So from browser i wont be able to directly work with database because of huge security issue.
 -In general modules are not responsible to work with databases.
 -Controllers will be receiving the data or working with data through web services.
 -So web services knows how to work with databases.
 -Views will never come to the from where the data is coming(means web services and databases) it only works with controller model.
