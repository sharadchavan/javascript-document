CLOSERS: NESTED FUNCTION + VARIABLE LOCAL TO THE OUTER SCOPE(REFERENCING ENVIRONMENT)
1.The nested function can access the referencing environment - even though those variable are
outside the scope.
2. The nested function carries around that referencing environment even after the scope has 
"gone away".

Now there could be multiple nested functions in the referencing environment. They will all share the same 
variables. (Not Copies)
